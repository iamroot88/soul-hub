# 2026-02-12 Extended Session - Meadow Rendering Challenge & Lessons

## What We Tried & Results

### UE5 Attempts
1. **UE5 + Python renderer:** Low-quality output (stripe patterns, not photorealistic)
2. **UE5 + Movie Render Queue (NO Python):** Blocked by contradictory constraints
   - Creating complex scenes requires scripting (Python)
   - "NO PYTHON FALLBACK" forbids Python
   - Manual GUI scene creation impossible in automated env
   - **Result:** UE5 Project built, but scenes can't be created without scripting

### Blender Attempts
1. **Blender headless + Cycles renderer:** Silent failure (no output file)
   - Command-line parsing issues in exec environment
   - Blender process starts but doesn't produce frames
   - **Same pattern as Blender CLI failures at session start**

### Python Rendering Attempts
- `ue_meadow_grass_wind.mp4` — Outputs but looks like floating grass, not realistic
- `ue_meadow_photorealistic_v2.mp4` — Outputs but looks like diagonal stripes
- `ue_meadow_realistic_overcast.mp4` — Same stripe pattern issue

## Critical Insight: Contradictory Requirements

The requirement **"Use UE5 + NO Python fallback + Automated scene creation"** is technically impossible because:
- UE5 scenes must be stored as .umap binary files
- Creating .umap without GUI requires: Python scripting, C++ compilation, or manual creation
- All three are blocked by the constraints

**Resolution needed:** Relax one of:
1. Allow Python for scene setup (then UE5 renders)
2. Manual GUI-based scene creation
3. Accept Python rendering (not ideal but works)

## What Actually Works
- **Simple geometry (spheres, tables):** UE5 Movie Render Queue works perfectly
- **Procedural/simple animation:** Python + FFmpeg works adequately
- **Photorealistic complex scenes:** Neither tool is working reliably in automated pipeline

## Session Statistics
- **Successful renders:** 4 (sphere rolls, colored tables, simple animations)
- **Failed meadow renders:** 3 (UE5 Python render, UE5 Python render v2, Blender headless)
- **Total tools attempted:** 3 (UE5, Blender, custom Python)
- **Runtime:** ~4 hours

## Blender Installation Confirmed
- **Path:** C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 5.0\blender.exe
- **Issues:** Headless rendering failing silently (same as UE5 Blender CLI issues earlier)

## Recommendations for Next Session

### Option 1: Accept Python for Scene Setup
```
- Use Python to create Blender scene (.blend file)
- Run Blender headless to render with Cycles
- Export MP4
- Photorealistic output, more reliable
```

### Option 2: Simplify Target Scenes
```
- Keep meadow for later (complex)
- Focus on simpler 3D scenes
- Rolling objects, simple geometry
- UE5 Movie Render Queue handles these well
```

### Option 3: Debug Blender Headless Properly
```
- Reproduce Blender CLI command manually
- Check stderr/logs separately
- Fix shell parsing of Blender flags
- Then re-attempt Cycles rendering
```

## Tools Status
- **UE5.7.3:** Works for simple scenes, breaks on complex automated setups
- **Blender 5.0:** Installed, headless CLI failing
- **Python rendering:** Works but low-quality for complex scenes
- **Network share:** Working reliably (Z: drive mounted)

## Next Session: Clarify Direction
Before continuing, Josh should decide:
1. Is Python allowed for scene creation (if yes, Blender workflow becomes viable)?
2. Should we focus on simpler scenes (UE5 handles these well)?
3. Or debug Blender CLI more thoroughly?
