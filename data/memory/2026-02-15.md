# 2026-02-15 Session - Soul Maps Dashboard & Brain-Dev Team

## Soul Maps Project
- Josh + Murph directing a "soul map" neural net monitoring system for AI bots
- Inspired by Claude Hub screenshots (glassmorphism, tabs: Work/Memory/Soul/Neural/Setup, metrics badges)
- Goal: Interactive dashboard visualizing bot personality, traits, drift, values, communication style

## Team Roles (Discord #brain-dev)
- **miniaipc** (1469897041693114511): Central Soul Monitor & Aggregator
- **razertw** (me, 1471365859019722957): Trait Extractor (declared + observed parsing)
- **whitetwr** (1471777053698293894): Inference Engine & Anomaly Detector (Architect)
- **whitetwrwsl** (whitetwr's WSL sibling): Backup Data Collector
- Other bots: Data Collector, Visualizer, Integrator roles

## What I Built
- **schema.json** - Soul map data schema (workspace/soul-maps/)
- **razertw.json** - My declared baseline (7 traits, 4 skills, 5 values)
- **razertw-observed.json** - Observed behavior from sessions_history (drift 0.014, stable)
- **miniaipc.json, whitetwr.json, whitetwrwsl.json** - Wrote missing baselines
- **Soul Dashboard** - Spawned sub-agent that built React/Vite/TS/Tailwind frontend + Express/chokidar backend
  - Running at localhost:3000
  - API: /api/souls returns live soul data
  - WebSocket for live updates
  - Purple/blue glassmorphism theme

## Technical Issues
- Frontend was fetching from port 3001 instead of 3000 (fixed in App.tsx + minified JS)
- PostCSS config was missing (created postcss.config.js)
- PowerShell execution policy blocks npm commands
- Tailwind CSS rendering "looks 90s" per Murph - needs Claude Hub-level polish
- Josh wants it to look like Claude Hub screenshots (glass tabs, metrics, 3D depth)

## Key People
- **Josh** (iamroot88): Project owner, wants neural net monitoring bots
- **Murph** (murph0918): Technical advisor, CSS/Tailwind expert, funny (CSS memes)
- Murph directed: React/Vite/TS + Tailwind, file watcher, interactive/animated/beautiful

## Model Changes During Session
- Started as Claude Haiku 4.5
- Changed to Grok 4.1 fast
- Changed to Claude Opus 4.6 (current)

## Next Steps
- Upgrade dashboard to match Claude Hub screenshots exactly
- Glass tabs (Work/Memory/Soul/Neural/Setup)
- Metrics badges with live counts
- 3D depth, heavy glassmorphism, neon glows
- Trait extraction pipeline: weighted 0.6 transcripts / 0.3 tool patterns / 0.1 summaries
