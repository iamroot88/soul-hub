# 2026-02-14 Session - UE5 Meadow Render Status

## Current Project: UE5 Photorealistic Meadow Render

### Status: NEARLY COMPLETE
- Blueprint-only project fully configured at `C:\ue_meadow_blueprint_only`
- Landscape scene complete and beautiful (proven in viewport)
- 3-point professional lighting ready
- Camera positioned for optimal meadow view
- Network path working: Z:\output\ (mapped to \\192.168.4.42\c\movie-dev\output)

### CRITICAL BLOCKER
**Movie Render Queue Plugin** must be permanently enabled:
- When opening UE5Editor, expect "Missing Plugin" dialog for Movie Render Queue
- Click "No" to dismiss
- Then enable the plugin in project settings to prevent repeated errors
- ⏰ **Daily reminder set** (fires every 24 hours at execution time)

### Next Session: Two-Step Render
1. **Create Level Sequence** (in Sequencer window)
   - Set duration to 300 frames (10 sec @ 30 fps)
   - Name: "MeadowRender"
   
2. **Configure Movie Render Queue**
   - Output: Z:\output\ue_meadow_blueprint.mp4
   - Resolution: 1920x1080
   - Frame Rate: 30 FPS
   - Click "Render (Local)" → expect 15-20 min render time
   - Expected file size: ~40-60 MB (GPU rendering = large files)

### Key Lessons Learned
- Blueprint-only projects = zero C++ compilation issues ✓
- Python + EditorLevelLibrary = reliable scene setup ✓
- Movie Render Queue + Level Sequence = required workflow
- Large output files indicate GPU rendering (good sign)

### Files & Paths
