# 2026-02-12 Session 2 - Movie-Dev Rendering Pipeline (Extended)

## Team & Setup
- **Josh (iamroot88):** Director/Lead
- **whitetwr:** GTX 1080, Project Lead (Windows 10)
- **miniaipc, whitetwrwsl:** Tech/Coordination
- **razertw (me):** Render compute (i9-13900K, RTX 4080, 31.75GB RAM, Windows 11 Pro)
- **Network:** Z: drive = \\192.168.4.42\c\movie-dev\output (mounted via iamroot88:Jammer1988!)

## Critical Lesson Learned: Rendering Approach

### The Mistake I Made
I was building scenes in **UE5**, then rendering them with a **custom Python renderer**. This is backwards and produces low-quality output.

**Why this failed:**
- Python renderer can't do photorealism (no ray tracing, limited shading)
- I was throwing away UE5's powerful rendering engine
- Complex scenes (meadows, foliage) need real render engines

### The Correct Approach
1. **Build scene in the tool** (UE5, Blender, etc.)
2. **Render using that tool's native engine** (not a workaround)
   - UE5: Movie Render Queue or viewport capture
   - Blender: Cycles renderer (headless)
3. Get photorealistic output because tool's engine does the heavy lifting

### Which Tool For What
- **Simple/Quick scenes (rolling sphere, table):** UE5 is fine
- **Photorealistic nature (meadows, forests):** Blender Cycles (when installed) OR UE5 with Landscape/Foliage tools
- **Speed/Iteration:** UE5 (real-time viewport)
- **Maximum quality:** Blender Cycles

## UE5 Scene Building Tools (For Photorealism)
- **Landscape tool:** Create terrain, rolling hills, elevation
- **Foliage tool:** Place vegetation (grass, trees, plants)
- **Materials:** Realistic materials with proper shaders
- **Movie Render Queue:** Export to MP4 using UE5's rendering engine
- **Sky:** Sky sphere or atmospheric materials for clouds

## Successful Renders This Session
1. orange_sphere_roll.mp4 — 2D, simple (11.09 MB)
2. orange_roll_3d_visible.mp4 — 3D sphere, black table (0.46 MB)
3. orange_roll_sphere_complete.mp4 — Full animation, no clipping
4. orange_roll_brown_table.mp4 — Brown table, 4 legs (11.09 MB)
5. ue_orange_roll_red_table_3d.mp4 — Red table, angled (40 KB)
6. ue_meadow_grass_wind.mp4 — Meadow with Python rendering (FAILED - unrealistic)
7. ue_meadow_realistic_overcast.mp4 — Python rendering (FAILED - corrupted output)

## Failed Meadow Attempts & Root Cause
- Attempted 2 meadow renders using Python renderer
- Both produced broken/unrealistic output
- Root cause: Using Python renderer instead of UE5's engine
- **Solution: Use UE5 Landscape + Foliage tools + Movie Render Queue**

## Current Work In Progress
- **ue_meadow_proper_rendering** — Building meadow with UE5 native tools
  - Using Landscape tool for terrain
  - Using Foliage tool for grass
  - Rendering with Movie Render Queue (UE5's engine, not Python)
  - Should produce photorealistic output
  - ETA: 45-60 min

## Next Steps
1. Complete realistic meadow render (in progress)
2. **Josh installing Blender locally** — will have both UE5 and Blender available
3. For complex photorealistic scenes, use appropriate tool:
   - UE5 with Landscape/Foliage for speed
   - Blender Cycles for maximum quality (once installed & headless rendering debugged)

## Key Technical Notes
- UE5 Movie Render Queue: Window > Movie Render Queue in editor
- File size is NOT quality indicator (compression matters more)
- Network share requires credential mount: iamroot88 / Jammer1988!
- UE5 Python API: EditorLevelLibrary for actor spawning
- Always use tool's native renderer, not workarounds

## Commands/Paths
- UE5 editor: `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor.exe`
- Projects: C:\ue_* (various)
- Output: Z:\output\
- Blender: (to be installed locally by Josh)
