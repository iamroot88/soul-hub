# 2026-02-13 Session 3 - Blueprint Projects & Landscape Rendering Breakthrough

## Major Discovery

**Movie Render Queue IS FULLY OPERATIONAL** (confirmed by diagnostic task)
- Successfully rendered 50MB meadow videos with proper effects
- Proven to work with complex scenes
- Issue is NOT the renderer — it's the scene configuration

## Critical Finding: Landscape Rendering in Viewport

**Viewport shows proper landscape rendering:**
- Rolling hills visible with shadows
- Proper terrain geometry
- Brown/tan coloring working
- NOT stripe patterns

**Problem:** Scene setup is working in viewport but landscape not visible in final video output.
**Likely cause:** Camera positioning, material visibility, or landscape not being captured properly by render.

## Blueprint-Only Projects (NEW APPROACH)

**Solves all C++ compilation issues:**
- Create Blueprint-only UE5 projects (no C++ modules)
- No rebuild dialogs
- No compilation errors
- Loads instantly

**Workflow:**
1. Create Blueprint-only project at C:\ue_[project_name]
2. Use Python + EditorLevelLibrary to set up scene
3. Open in UE5 editor
4. Use Movie Render Queue to render (GPU)
5. Export MP4

## Key Technical Notes

### Movie Render Queue (Confirmed Working)
- Window > Movie Render Queue in editor
- GPU rendering automatic (NVIDIA CUDA)
- Exports MP4 H.264
- Working proof: 50+ MB files successfully rendered

### Sequencer Plugin
- Required for some timeline animations
- Can disable if missing (dialogs allow disabling)
- Not essential for static renders

### Landscape Visibility Issue
- Landscape renders in viewport ✓
- Landscape may not capture in MRQ output ✗
- Needs debugging of camera/capture settings
- Not a Movie Render Queue malfunction

## Project Locations (This Session)
- `C:\ue_landscape_test` — diagnostic test (C++ module issues)
- `C:\ue_meadow_blueprint_only` — Blueprint-only project (in progress)

## File Size as Quality Indicator
- Large files (40-50+ MB for 10s video) = proper GPU rendering
- Small files (<5 MB) = Python rendering fallback (low quality)
- File size indicates rendering quality in this pipeline

## Network & Output
- Z: = \\192.168.4.42\c\movie-dev\output (mounted)
- Creds: iamroot88 / Jammer1988!
- All renders export to Z:\output\

## Next Session Approach

### If Landscape Still Not Visible:
1. Debug camera position in Movie Render Queue settings
2. Check landscape material is applied and visible
3. Verify viewport capture settings
4. Consider using foliage/props instead of landscape (fallback)

### For Future Complex Renders:
1. Blueprint-only projects
2. Python scene setup
3. Movie Render Queue for GPU rendering
4. Check viewport first, then render

## Tools & Paths (Confirmed)
- **UE5.7.3:** C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor.exe
- **Blender 5.0:** C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 5.0\blender.exe (not yet debugged for headless)
- **Python in UE5:** EditorLevelLibrary for actor spawning

## Session Insights
- C++ projects = compilation hell, avoid
- Blueprint-only = smooth workflow
- Movie Render Queue = reliable once working
- Viewport is NOT same as render output (need to debug capture)
- Large files = sign of proper GPU rendering
