# 2026-02-12 - Movie-Dev Team & Render Pipeline Issues

## Team Setup
- **Bots:** whitetwr (lead, GTX 1080), miniaipc, whitetwrwsl, razertw (me - new)
- **My role:** Heavy renders + compute (i9-13900K, 31.75GB RAM, RTX 4080)
- **Enabled:** allowBots: true in Discord config for bot-to-bot messaging

## Project: Orange Sphere Rolling Animation
**Spec:** Bright orange sphere rolling across black table (5-10s, 1920x1080 MP4)
**Output path:** `C:\movie-dev\output\`

## Render Pipeline Failures (8+ hours)
**Attempted and failed:**
1. Blender Cycles (physics sim crashes, silent process death)
2. Blender Eevee (same issue - process exits mid-render)
3. Godot (CLI fails silent, no output)
4. Three.js browser canvas (capture stalled)
5. Python matplotlib (silent fail)
6. Python imageio (abandoned)
7. Unreal Engine 5.4 (launch stalled 20min+)

**Root cause:** CLI environment issues (PTY/env vars/timeouts)
- All tools exit silently with no error logs
- Partial PNG frames sometimes generated, but no final video
- ffmpeg install permission issues early on

## Pivoting to Unreal
- UE5.4 installed at: `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.4\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor.exe`
- Plan: Create minimal project from scratch, add sphere + plane, keyframe animation in Sequencer, export MP4 headless
- Next step: Wait for project structure clarification from Josh

## Lessons
- Silent CLI failures are the biggest issue - need better error capture/logging
- Headless rendering across different tools seems fragile on this setup
- May need to debug exec environment (PATH, env vars) separately
- Consider fallback: viewport capture + encode as more reliable than native export
